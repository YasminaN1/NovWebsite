Dear ${userName},

I hope this letter finds you feeling ${adjective1} and ready for an adventure! The Pogues and I have discovered an old map that could lead us straight to the legendary gold of the Outer Banks.

We’ll be meeting at ${place} at ${time} to begin our journey. Make sure to pack a ${adjective2} ${noun1} and don’t forget your ${pluralNoun1}—trust me, we’ll need them.

If we run into trouble, just yell "${exclamation}" and we’ll stick to the plan. I can’t wait to see you there—let’s make history, Pogues-style!
